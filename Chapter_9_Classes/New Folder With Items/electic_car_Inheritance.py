Thereâ€™s no limit to how much you can specialize the ElectricCar class. You can add as many
attributes and methods as you need to model an electric car to whatever degree of accuracy you need.
An attribute or method that could belong to any car, rather than one thats specific to an electric
car, should be added to the Car class instead of the ElectricCar class. Then anyone who uses the Car
class will have that functionality available as well, and the ElectricCar class will only contain code
for the information and behavior specific to electric vehicles.'''
