# Three way to exit a while loop:
# fail conditional test in while loop.
# use break statement when the user enters a 'quit' value
# use active variable when the use enters a 'quit' value.

# prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' to close program. "

# age = ""

#         elif age >= 12:
#             print("\n$15\n")
#     else:
#         print("Try again.")
