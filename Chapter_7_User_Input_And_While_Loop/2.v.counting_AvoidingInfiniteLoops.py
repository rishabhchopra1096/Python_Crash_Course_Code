print ("Every while loop needs a way to stop running so it would not continue to run forever.")

x = 1
while x<=5:
    print(x)
    x+=1
#If i omit the line x+=1 , the loop will run forever , printing 1 again and again.
# If a program enters a while loop : press control+C or just close terminal window.
# Test every while loop and make sure it stops when you want it to stop.
# If you want your program to end when someone enters the input value , run the prgram and test
# weather that input value works.
# If it does not end , scrutinize as to why the loop is becoming infinite.
# Make sure at least one part of the program can make the loop's conditions False or
# cause it to reach a break statement.
