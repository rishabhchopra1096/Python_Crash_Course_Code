''' The for loop takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once for each item
#  in the collection. In contrast, the while loop runs as long as, or while, a certain condition
#   is true. It also takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once for each item
in the collection.'''
#The following function counts from 1 to 5.

current_number=1
while current_number<=5:
    print (current_number)
    current_number+=1

'''The += operatior is shorthand for current_number=current_number+1'''
'''A game needs a while loop to keep running as long as you want to keep
playing and so it can stop running as soon as you ask to quit'''
