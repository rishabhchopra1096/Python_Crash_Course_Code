# Customizing Sublime Text Settings
# Now we’ll set up Sublime Text to be as efficient as possible by customizing the
#  features mentioned at the beginning of this appendix.
# Converting Tabs to Spaces
# Go to View4Indentation and make sure there’s a check mark next to Indent Using
#  Spaces. If there isn’t, check it.

# at the 80-character mark.
