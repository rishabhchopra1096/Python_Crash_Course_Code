# 3-1. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called
#  names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list
#  , one at a time.

names = ['rishabh','manan','samarth']
print(names[0])
print(names[1])
print(names[2])


# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead
# of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of
# each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized
#  with the persons name.

print("Hello, " + names[0].title())
print("Hello, " + names[1].title())
print("Hello, " + names[2].title())
